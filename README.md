# Secure Azure App Starter

A DevSecOps-ready Azure infrastructure template with automated security scanning and CI/CD deployment. It is CI/CD gate that runs Checkov and Trivy on every push, blocking commits with policy violations, exposed secrets, or known CVEs before they reach the infrastructure.

## What problem am I solving?
Azure environments often accumulate unvalidated Terraform configs and unscanned secrets that slip through manual reviews. These gaps become attack surfaces before anyone notices.

## Why does it matter?
Catching misconfigurations at commit time prevents the kind of drift that leads to real breaches. One blocked commit today is one less incident response tomorrow.

## What's Deployed

- Azure VNet with isolated subnet (northeurope)
- Network Security Group enforcing HTTPS-only inbound traffic
- GitHub Actions pipeline with Checkov + Trivy security scanning on every push/PR
- Automated Terraform deploy workflow using service principal authentication

## Tech Stack

- Terraform (IaC)
- GitHub Actions (CI/CD)
- Checkov (Terraform policy scanning)
- Trivy (misconfiguration detection)
- Azure (VNet, NSG, Subnet)

## How It Works

1. Push to main triggers security scans (Checkov + Trivy)
2. If scans pass, Terraform plan + apply deploys infra to Azure
3. NSG enforces least-privilege network access by default

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repo
2. Configure Azure service principal as GitHub secrets (ARM_CLIENT_ID, ARM_CLIENT_SECRET, ARM_SUBSCRIPTION_ID, ARM_TENANT_ID)
3. Push to main and watch the pipeline deploy
